**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 11, 2025
**Author:** Gemini AI

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for the JSON/XLSX processing library. The purpose of this library is to provide functionality for parsing and generating data in JSON and XLSX (Excel) formats. This test plan defines the scope, objectives, resources, and approach for testing the core functionalities of this library.

## 2. Test Objectives

The primary objectives of this testing effort are to:

* **Verify correct parsing of JSON data:** Ensure the library can accurately read and interpret data from various valid and edge-case JSON structures.
* **Verify correct generation of JSON data:** Ensure the library can generate valid JSON output from internal data structures.
* **Verify correct parsing of XLSX data:** Ensure the library can accurately read and interpret data from various valid and edge-case XLSX files, including different data types, formatting (if applicable), and multiple sheets.
* **Verify correct generation of XLSX data:** Ensure the library can generate valid XLSX files with correct data representation, handling different data types, and supporting multiple sheets.
* **Validate error handling:** Ensure the library gracefully handles invalid input data (malformed JSON, corrupted XLSX files) and provides informative error messages or exceptions.
* **Assess performance for large datasets:** Evaluate the library's performance (memory usage, processing time) when handling large JSON and XLSX files.
* **Ensure platform compatibility (if applicable):** Verify the library functions correctly across the intended runtime environments (e.g., Node.js, browser).

## 3. Scope of Testing

The testing will cover the following core functionalities of the library:

* **JSON Parsing:**
    * Basic JSON structures (objects, arrays, primitives).
    * Nested JSON structures.
    * JSON with null, boolean, number, and string values.
    * Empty JSON objects and arrays.
    * JSON with special characters (handling of encoding).
    * Handling of large JSON files.
* **JSON Generation:**
    * Generating basic JSON structures from internal data.
    * Generating nested JSON structures.
    * Handling different data types during generation.
    * Generating large JSON outputs.
* **XLSX Parsing:**
    * Reading data from single and multiple sheet XLSX files.
    * Handling various data types within cells (string, number, boolean, date).
    * Handling empty cells.
    * Basic handling of cell formatting (if the library aims to preserve or expose it).
    * Handling of large XLSX files.
* **XLSX Generation:**
    * Creating single and multiple sheet XLSX files.
    * Writing different data types to cells.
    * Handling of column headers (if applicable).
    * Generating large XLSX files.
* **Error Handling:**
    * Attempting to parse malformed JSON.
    * Attempting to parse invalid or corrupted XLSX files.
    * Attempting to generate JSON/XLSX with invalid data inputs (if applicable).

The testing will **not** explicitly cover:

* Advanced XLSX formatting (styles, fonts, colors, complex layouts) unless specifically mentioned in the library's features.
* Complex XLSX features like formulas, charts, or macros, unless the library explicitly supports them.
* Specific performance benchmarks beyond general assessment for large datasets.
* Security testing.
* Accessibility testing.

## 4. Test Approach

The primary test approach will involve:

* **Automated Testing:** Writing unit and integration tests using a testing framework (e.g., Chai, Jest, Mocha) to verify the functionality of individual components and their interactions.
* **Manual Testing:** Performing exploratory testing and specific scenario-based testing, especially for edge cases and error handling, and to validate the output formats.
* **Data-Driven Testing:** Utilizing various JSON and XLSX sample files (both valid and invalid) to ensure the library handles different data structures and edge cases correctly.

## 5. Test Environment

The tests will be executed in the following environment(s):

* **Development Environment:** Developers will run tests locally on their machines (macOS, Windows, Linux).
* **Continuous Integration (CI) Environment:** Automated tests will be executed on the CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) to ensure code quality with every commit.
* **Node.js:** The primary runtime environment for the library. Specific Node.js versions as defined in the project's documentation.

## 6. Test Data

The following types of test data will be used:

* **Valid JSON Files:** A collection of `.json` files representing various valid JSON structures, including basic, nested, and large files.
* **Invalid JSON Files:** A collection of `.json` files with syntax errors and malformed structures to test error handling.
* **Valid XLSX Files:** A collection of `.xlsx` files with single and multiple sheets, containing different data types and varying sizes.
* **Invalid XLSX Files:** A collection of `.xlsx` files that are corrupted or have unexpected structures to test error handling.
* **Programmatically Generated Data:** Creating in-memory data structures to test the JSON and XLSX generation functionalities.

The test data files will ideally be stored under a dedicated `test-data` subdirectory within the `tests` folder.

## 7. Test Cases

Refer to [Test Cases Document](test-cases.md).

## 8. Test Execution

1. **Setup:** Ensure the test environment is properly configured with the necessary dependencies.
2. **Execution:** Run automated tests using the configured test runner. Execute manual tests following the defined test case steps.
3. **Reporting:** Record the results of each test case (pass/fail, actual results, any observations). Automated test runners will generate reports. Manual test results will be documented (e.g., in the test case files or a separate report).
4. **Analysis:** Analyze the test results to identify defects and areas for improvement.
5. **Retesting:** Fix identified defects and re-run the failed test cases to verify the fixes.

## 9. Entry and Exit Criteria

**Entry Criteria for Testing:**

* The library has reached a stable and testable state for the features outlined in the scope.
* Test environment is set up and accessible.
* Test data is prepared and available.
* Initial set of automated and manual test cases are defined.

**Exit Criteria for Testing:**

* All planned test cases have been executed.
* A predefined percentage of test cases have passed (e.g., 95%).
* All critical and high-priority defects have been resolved and retested successfully.
* Test coverage meets the defined requirements (if any).
* Stakeholders have reviewed and approved the test results.

## 10. Roles and Responsibilities

* **Developers:** Responsible for writing unit tests, fixing defects identified during testing, and ensuring code quality.
* **Testers (if applicable):** Responsible for defining test plans, creating test cases, executing manual tests, analyzing test results, and reporting defects.
* **QA Engineers (if applicable):** May have a broader role in defining the testing strategy, setting up test environments, and managing the overall testing process.

## 11. Test Reporting

Test results will be reported as follows:

* **Automated Test Reports:** Generated by the test runner (e.g., HTML reports from Mocha/Jest/Cypress). These reports will be stored under the `tests/reports` directory.
* **Manual Test Reports:** Documented in a designated format (e.g., within the test case files or a summary document).
* **Summary Reports:** Periodic reports summarizing the overall test execution status, defect metrics, and test coverage.

## 12. Tools

The following tools may be used during the testing process:

* **Testing Framework:** Chai (as specified), Jest, Mocha, or a combination.
* **Assertion Library:** Built-in assertions of the chosen testing framework or Chai.
* **Test Runner:** Node.js test runner (e.g., `npm test`, `yarn test`).
* **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or similar.
* **Text Editor/IDE:** VS Code, IntelliJ, or similar.
* **Spreadsheet Software:** Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets (for creating and inspecting XLSX test data).
* **JSON Viewer/Editor:** For inspecting and validating JSON test data.

## 13. Risks and Mitigation

* **Large Data Handling Complexity:** Testing performance with very large files might be time-consuming and resource-intensive. **Mitigation:** Start with moderately large files and gradually increase the size. Focus on memory usage and basic processing time.
* **XLSX Format Variability:** XLSX is a complex format, and different tools might generate slightly different structures. **Mitigation:** Create test files using various common tools (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, openpyxl) to ensure broad compatibility.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** If the library involves asynchronous operations, testing these correctly can be challenging. **Mitigation:** Utilize the asynchronous testing features of the chosen testing framework (e.g., `async/await`, Promises).
* **Limited Resources:** If testing resources (time, personnel) are limited, prioritize testing core functionalities and critical error handling scenarios. **Mitigation:** Focus on high-impact test cases first and consider automation where it provides the most value.

## 14. Future Considerations

* **Performance Benchmarking:** Implement more rigorous performance tests with specific metrics and thresholds.
* **Memory Profiling:** Use memory profiling tools to identify potential memory leaks or inefficiencies when handling large data.
* **Fuzz Testing:** Employ fuzzing techniques to discover unexpected behavior with malformed input data.
* **Integration Testing with External Systems:** If the library interacts with other systems, plan for integration tests.

This test plan provides a framework for testing the JSON/XLSX processing library. It will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the development lifecycle.
